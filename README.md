# Learning React-router
In this [directory](https://github.com/harshrajhrj/react-grasp/tree/react-router), I learned important react feature which is `react-router-dom`.
## Things to be done before getting started
* In `index.js`, we've imported `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom` and wrapped entire `<App />` working tree inside `BrowserRouter` to get full features of `react-router-dom`.
* ```javascript import {BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom';```
## What I've done?
First we're gonna configure two routes namely-
+ `home` - Home page
+ `about` - About page

`Server running at port 3000`
