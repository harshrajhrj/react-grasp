# Learning React-router<sup>[Source](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)</sup>
In this [directory](https://github.com/harshrajhrj/react-grasp/tree/react-router), I learned important react feature which is `react-router-dom`.
## Things to be done before getting started
* In *index.js*, we've imported `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom` and wrapped entire `<App />` working tree inside *BrowserRouter* component to get full features of *react-router-dom*.
* Syntax for import and BrowserRouter
```javascript
import {BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <App />
    </BrowserRouter>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
